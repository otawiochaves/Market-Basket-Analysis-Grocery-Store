# Retail Data Analysis Project MBA

Welcome to my retail data analysis project! The primary focus remains on developing and researching solutions to enhance retail operations. The objective of this project is to leverage data from an unidentified grocery store and perform a comprehensive basket analysis. By analyzing customer purchase patterns, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can drive strategic decision-making.

Throughout the project, we will explore interactive visualizations to effectively communicate and explore the data. Interactive visualizations provide an intuitive and dynamic way to understand complex patterns and trends within the retail dataset. We will emphasize the significance of data visualization as a powerful tool for guiding and validating decisions. By presenting data in visually appealing and interactive formats, we can facilitate a deeper understanding of the underlying trends and relationships.

By combining data analysis techniques, algorithmic approaches, and impactful visualizations, this project aims to unlock actionable insights and drive retail growth. Thank you for your interest in this project, and I look forward to sharing the findings and insights with the GitHub community.

As believed by Li (2017) "Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy."
