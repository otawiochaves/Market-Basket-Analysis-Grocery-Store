# Retail Data Analysis: Basket Analysis and Algorithm Comparison

Welcome to my retail data analysis project! This project is part of my Higher Diploma in Data course and will be included in my GitHub portfolio. The main focus of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of basket data in an unidentified grocery store. Additionally, we will compare the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms to identify their differences and performance in basket analysis.

## Overview

In this project, we explore basket analysis techniques to uncover associations between frequently co-purchased items. By identifying these relationships, we can gain valuable insights that drive strategic decision-making in the retail industry.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of transactions from an unidentified grocery store. Each transaction is represented by a list of purchased items. We will leverage this data to conduct a comprehensive analysis of shopping baskets.

## Apriori and FP-Growth Algorithms

In this project, we compare the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for basket analysis. We will evaluate the performance and differences between these algorithms in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy in discovering item associations.

## Interactive Visualizations

In addition to basket analysis, we also explore interactive visualizations to compare purchase information between the years 2014 and 2015. We utilize intuitive and dynamic visualizations to highlight relevant trends and patterns in the retail data.

## Results and Conclusions

The results of this analysis provide valuable insights into item associations in retail basket data. By comparing the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms, we were able to identify performance differences and evaluate their applicability in the context of basket analysis.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you for your interest in this project. The findings and insights obtained will be shared with the GitHub community.
